                <p class="html-blocks__text font2">While many in the industry have moved to "All-Purpose Cleaners" for much of your vehicle, we use different products specifically designed for each part of your car or truck! Can you imagine if you came home and your new leather couch was being cleaned with the same chemicals as the garage sink or the toilet? Why should your vehicle be any different? Plastic surfaces are cleaned and protected with products made for plastics. Leather is cleaned and conditioned with leather cleaners and conditioners. Your wheels are treated with an acid-free wheel cleaner that is specifically designed to remove brake dust and contaminants. In short, we use the best products available to protect your car, truck, or SUV.</p>

                  <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">Our Interior Detail and our 360 Detail both include a superior level of service for the interior of your car, truck, or SUV. On top of the typical equipment like a vacuum and a compressor, we use a high-end Mytee brand extractor.</p>
                  <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">&nbsp;A Tornador filled with a high-end cleaner and UV protectant is used to remove hard-to-get dirt and dust. Leather is brushed with SONAX cleaner and conditioner that both remove existing stains and help to prevent new ones.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">A specialized Dashboard cleaner is used on most vinyl surfaces to clean and protect from UV. Stains in the fabric are treated, and the extractor is used while the headliner is cleaned by hand. Floor mats are power-washed, treated, scrubbed, and washed again.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">We also have WeatherTech mats available for purchase and installation. Your interior glass is cleaned with care to make sure we wipe the opposite direction from your exterior glass -- so if a spot was missed, we know where and fix it before we give you your keys. A lighter strength cleaner is applied to all screens and cockpit areas.</p>

Both our 360 Detail package and our Exterior Detail package use industry-specific and highly specialized products. For example, SONAX Wheel Cleaner Plus or Beast will be used on your rims, a fallout remover over the entire vehicle if necessary. ActiFoam or equivalent for the wash process. Perfect Finish for the light polish, and a high-quality spray ceramic will be applied to finish it off. Our rinse water is purified using a RODI or CR Spotless system. Your glass is cleaned with a professional glass cleaner and specialized accessories to eliminate streaks and residue.</p>

                    <p class="html-blocks-products__desc font2">We spend a lot of time outdoors here in the valley. We do everything in our power to make sure the chemicals we use are environmentally friendly. Furthermore, all wastewater goes through a multi-stage filtration system. Lastly, by using pressurized equipment, we reduce water consumption considerably while accomplishing better results</p>
